What do you need?
Just docker!!! Install docker, and run
./build.sh on Mac OS X (should be the same for linux)
This uses a similiar bootstrap to Mobian but done in ansible and not hidden in packages whats being done.
We Bootstrap Debian, using ansible preconfigure everything 
This should be straight up debian, with some modifications all shown in ansible
